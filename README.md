# Chatbot Website

Welcome to the Chatbot Website project! This repository provides a simple example of a chatbot implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, along with Node.js and Express for the backend.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the chatbot website on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Initialize the Project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
2. Run the command `npm init -y` to initialize a new Node.js project.

### Install Dependencies

Run `npm install express body-parser` to install the necessary dependencies.

### Create Project Files

1. Create a file named `index.js` for the backend.
2. Create a folder named `public` for the frontend files.

### Backend Setup

Copy the provided backend code from `index.js` for the Express server.

### Frontend Setup

1. Create an HTML file (`public/index.html`).
2. Create a CSS file (`public/style.css`).
3. Create a JavaScript file (`public/script.js`) in the `public` folder.
4. Copy the provided frontend code into these files.

### Run the Application

Execute `node index.js` in your terminal to start the server.

### Access the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: Backend code for the Express server.
- `public/index.html`: Frontend HTML structure.
- `public/style.css`: Styling for the chatbot UI.
- `public/script.js`: JavaScript for handling user interactions.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the chatbot functionality, UI/UX, and add more features based on your project requirements. For a more advanced chatbot experience, consider integrating natural language processing libraries like Dialogflow, Wit.ai, or Microsoft Bot Framework.

Happy coding!
